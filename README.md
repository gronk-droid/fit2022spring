# FIT Spring 2022
Grant Butler
Computer Science, B.S.

This repository contains work from all courses in my Spring 2022 Semester at the Florida Institute of Technology. It contains all of the work I did and hopefully details what I learned in a clean and precise manner. It also will serve as a way for me to learn different tools on GitHub and hopefully make me a better Software Engineer.
