# FIT Spring 2022

Computer Science, B.S.

This repository contains work from all courses in my Spring 2022 Semester at the Florida Institute of Technology. It contains all of the work I did and hopefully details what I learned in a clean and precise manner. It also will serve as a way for me to learn different tools on GitHub and hopefully make me a better Software Engineer.
